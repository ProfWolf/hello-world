Hello world repository tutorial (as per GitHub Guide instructions)

Considering changing my profile name. "ProfWolf" is a reference to the training I've done in the past on SDLC's, Agile, and even a stint as an Adjunct Professor. However, here I'm just a n00b-student. My Master's degree in Software Engineering has gotten horribly stale as I haven't coded in years. Now I'm just trying to re-educate myself before getting back into the mix.
